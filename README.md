# Intro
A mini project build for self to learn how finite state machine works on Godot. I will update the notes later to share info like what is the aim of the mini project aside from learning state machine, why write certain scripts like so and so on.

## Regarding Assets
Since I used assets that might cause issue with the license, I will put all files inside assets folder under the .gitignore file until I sort things up.
